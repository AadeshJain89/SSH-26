# Backend

This backend is a deterministic, rule-based engine that:
- verifies claimed skills
- identifies skill gaps
- applies a personal learning pacer
- generates a role-specific learning roadmap

Scope (Prototype):
- No authentication
- No database
- No AI/ML
- JSON-based data

Focus is on correctness, explainability, and clarity.
